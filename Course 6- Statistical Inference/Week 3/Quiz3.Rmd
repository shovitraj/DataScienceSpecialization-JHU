1. In a population of interest, a sample of 9 men yielded a sample average brain volume of 1,100cc and a standard deviation of 30cc. What is a 95% Studentâ€™s T confidence interval for the mean brain volume in this new population?

```{r}
m <- 1100; p <- 0.95; s <- 30; n <- 9; 
c <- m + c(-1,1) * qt(p + (1-p)/2, (n-1) * s/sqrt(n))
```
